## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Native mobile apps (initial release is web-only).
- Full-fledged CRM features beyond recruitment outreach and logs.
- Advanced analytics dashboards (beyond basic metrics) in MVP.
- Automated offer management or onboarding workflows.


## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- Web app built with Next.js + TypeScript using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for UI components.
- Information architecture (MVP):
  - Login
  - Dashboard (enter Job ID, recent jobs)
  - Results List (ranking table, threshold slider, filters, custom instructions)
  - Candidate Detail Drawer (score breakdown, matched evidence, resume preview)
  - Outreach Composer (WhatsApp, Email, Voice)
  - JD Generator
  - Settings (rubric defaults, providers, templates, compliance, API keys)
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, color contrast; exportable shortlist PDFs where needed.


## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- Models: Prefer OpenAI gpt-5 if available; fallback to GPT-4o family. Implement provider abstraction.
- Ceipal: Use official API for authentication, job/applicant retrieval, and optional write-back of statuses/notes.
- Parsing: Use best-available parser stack (e.g., pdfminer/textract/docx parsing) + LLM-based normalization for robust extraction.
- Storage: S3 (Mumbai) for originals and parsed JSON; pre-signed URLs for secure sharing.
- DB: Postgres + pgvector on Hetzner VPS; Prisma ORM optional; enforce migrations and indices for common filters.
- Search: Hybrid (filters + keyword + semantic). Create skill taxonomy normalization with embeddings.
- Outreach: 
  - WhatsApp providers (Meta/Twilio) behind an adapter interface.
  - Email via AWS SES initially.
  - Voice via Vapi initially; abstract for Retell/ElevenLabs later.
- Observability: Centralized logging, structured logs (JSON), redact PII in prompts; request IDs for traceability.
- Secrets: 
  - Dev: .env
  - Prod: AWS Secrets Manager or Doppler (final choice pending).
- Environment variables (provided): CEIPAL_EMAIL, CEIPAL_PASSWORD, CEIPAL_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID, GOOGLE_PUBLIC_URL.

## 9. Open Questions

- Ceipal sync cadence: keep on-demand only for MVP, or add background sync (interval/webhooks)?
- Ceipal rate limits/daily caps: any org-specific constraints we must honor?
- Voice provider finalization: start with Vapiâ€”acceptable? Any must-have for Retell or ElevenLabs in MVP?
- Email provider: proceed with AWS SES in MVP?
- Consent capture: what triggers explicit consent collection (first message vs per-channel)? Any template language constraints?
- Outreach windows: define default business hours and per-country rules.
- S3 bucket naming and retention policy (e.g., 12 months by default). Confirm data residency needs beyond Mumbai.
- LinkedIn scraping: daily cap, proxy provider choice, and fallback approach (e.g., enrichment services) if scraping is blocked.
- Client portal: MVP read-only link acceptable, or email-only for phase 1?
- Budget guardrails for LLM usage (daily/monthly caps and throughput targets).
